    <h1>Example 1 - Page Inspector</h1>
    <p>
      We can do a lot with the inspector! Try to check with the inspector <strong>this element for example</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try editing some of your DOM now. Double-click an element, or right-click it and choose Edit as HTML from the context menu. You can make any changes you'd like, but you cannot save your changes.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2 style="color:red;border:1px solid #333">We have some CSS inline applied here! Can you use CSS editor to change it?</h2>
    <p>
      By default, the CSS editor (in the right corner of the devtools) displays the CSS rules applied to the currently selected element.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what about <span class="big">this element?</span> We are using CSS classes here, try to change something and see what happens to all the <span class="big">elements</span> with the class.
